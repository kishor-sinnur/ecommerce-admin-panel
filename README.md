## Database Schema

The database schema can be implemented with **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**. Hereâ€™s a basic idea of the schema:

### Product Schema
```js
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  category: String,
  stock: Number,
  imageUrl: String
});
